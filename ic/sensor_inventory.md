## 1. Conventions

- **Class 1E** = safety-qualified, IEEE 323 / 344 environmental + seismic, IEC 60880 Cat A signal chain.
- **Non-1E** = control / monitoring only, no safety credit.
- **Redundancy n/N** = number of channels / number required to make a decision. e.g. **2/4** means 4 redundant channels with 2-of-4 voting.
- **Diversity** = different sensing principle covering the same variable (defense against common-cause failure).
- All channels include local indication + transmission to RPS/ESFAS or DCS as noted.

## 3. Coverage map — every safety criterion has at least one sensor

Cross-check against `safety/safety_criteria.yaml`:

| Safety criterion ID | Observed by | Trip |
|---|---|---|
| `k_eff_operating` | NF-PR | High flux trip |
| `mtc_full_power`, `dtc_doppler`, `void_coefficient` | NF-PR + T-HL + T-CL (derived) | — (DBE prevention, no trip) |
| `mdnbr_steady`, `mdnbr_transient` | F-LP + T-HL + T-CL + NF-PR (derived) | Low flow + OT-ΔT trip |
| `pct_loca` | T-CE (post-accident) | High outlet T trip |
| `fuel_centerline_temperature` | inferred (fuel model + NF-PR + T-HL) | — |
| `primary_pressure_design` | P-PZR | Hi/Lo pressurizer P trip |
| `containment_pressure` | P-CONT | High containment P → ESFAS CI |
| `sg_pressure_operating` | P-SG (#21) | MSI on low SG P (E5) |
| `operator_grace_period` | NF-SR + T-CE + L-SG-WR (passive monitoring set) | — |
| `cdf`, `lrf` | derived from PRA, not direct | — |
| `dose_site_boundary` | RAD-SB + plume model | — |
| `cycle_length`, `fuel_burnup_max`, `fuel_enrichment_max` | not real-time (operational) | — |

**Coverage complete:** every safety criterion that is observable in real time maps to ≥ 1 channel. The SG-pressure gap found in the first cross-check is now closed by channel #21 (P-SG), added to the master table above and wired to MSI (E5).

## 4. Post-accident monitoring (Reg Guide 1.97) subset

Sensors qualified to survive design-basis accident and provide information for ≥ 72 h passive operation:

| Channel | Type A/B/C/D/E | Survival qualified |
|---|---|---|
| T-CE (core exit T) | Type B (diagnose CSF integrity) | Yes |
| P-PZR | Type B | Yes |
| L-SG-WR | Type B (heat sink integrity) | Yes |
| P-CONT | Type C (barrier integrity) | Yes |
| RAD-CONT | Type C | Yes |
| Radiation: containment H₂ (add — see gaps §5) | Type C | Yes (planned) |
| L-PZR (wide-range) — to add | Type B | Planned |

Categories per RG 1.97 Rev 5:
- **Type A** — operator action info,
- **Type B** — CSF status,
- **Type C** — barrier integrity,
- **Type D** — system status,
- **Type E** — release assessment.

## 5. Gaps and additions (revisit Day 3)

| # | Gap | Add | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | No containment H₂ monitor (severe accident) | Add catalytic + thermal-conductivity H₂ monitors, RG 1.97 Type C | High |
| 2 | No pressurizer wide-range level (post-acc) | Add L-PZR-WR, dP, Class 1E | Medium |
| 3 | No EBIS instrumentation (diverse shutdown system #2) | Add EBIS tank level + boron-concentration meter + injection-line flow/valve-position (1E), feeding the DAS `ebis_actuation` confirm. Online coolant boron meter NOT needed in normal op (boron-free) — boron exists only in the dormant EBIS reserve. | High (was Low) — with Samira |
| 4 | No coolant activity monitor (online failed fuel detection) | Add primary coolant gamma spec | Low |
| 5 | IRWST level | Add 2-channel level for ECCS source | Medium |

## 6. Vendor / domestic sourcing note (FER §5.2 originality / domesticity)

Where possible Aegis-40 sensors should source from **domestic suppliers** to meet FER §5.2 ("domestic content"). Candidates by category (placeholder, confirm with team):
- RTDs / thermocouples — local instrumentation industry baseline.
- Pressure / dP transmitters — domestic process-industry suppliers.
- Neutron detectors, fission chambers — typically imported (specialist); flag as imported in §5.2.
- Radiation monitors — mixed (some domestic options).

Build a sourcing matrix once supply chain is mapped by the team.
